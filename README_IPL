Project Overview
Analyzed Indian Premier League (IPL) data to gain insights into team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes
Used data visualization techniques to represent findings and trends in the data
Key Findings
Team performance: Identified top teams by win count
Toss decision trends: Analyzed toss decision patterns and their impact on match outcomes
Match outcomes: Calculated the percentage of teams winning after winning the toss
Winning margins: Determined the team with the highest winning margin
Player performance:
Top players by "Player of the Match" awards
